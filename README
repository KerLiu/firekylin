FireKylin

    FireKylin is a simple implementation of A Unix-like Operating System
  based on x86. It won't like MINIX, it would use big kernel; it won't like
  Linux, I want it do not just a kernel, it also content command, sh, 
  untily,and so on, so I want it won't be like BSD.
    All of the Operating System development would be compatibe to one or 
  two other Operating System, so that it would attract more people change 
  to it . But for FireKylin. I just want to implemente it by my idea, I 
  really do not want to compatibe Operating System. But I would refer to 
  the design of other Opertimg System and porting code for them, like Linux,
  DSD, GNU .etc .
